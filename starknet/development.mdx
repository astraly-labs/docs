## Sample Code

If you are just trying to get started with our price feeds, see the self-contained code snippets below. If you'd like to use more advanced oracle functions please see the further information below. You can find a full sample data feed consumer contract [here](https://github.com/Astraly-Labs/pragma-hack/tree/master) and the full Oracle interface specification is available [here](https://github.com/astraly-labs/pragma-oracle/blob/main/pragma-oracle/src/oracle/oracle.cairo).

## (Optional) Add Pragma as a dependency to your scarb/snforge project

let price = get_asset_price_median(oracle_address, DataType::FutureEntry((KEY, expiration_timestamp)));
```

## Conversion Rate

For some assets such as liquid staking tokens, it's actually more relevant to use the conversion rate rather than the market price given the liquidity is often poor for these assets.

To use this special aggregation method, the base token first needs to be associated to a vault address which follows the ERC4626 standard.

#### Sample code

```rust
use pragma_lib::abi::{IPragmaABIDispatcher, IPragmaABIDispatcherTrait};
use pragma_lib::types::{AggregationMode, DataType, PragmaPricesResponse};
use starknet::ContractAddress;
use starknet::contract_address::contract_address_const;

const KEY :felt252 = 1629317993172502401860; // felt252 conversion of "XSTRK/USD", can write const KEY : felt252 = 'XSTRK/USD'

fn get_asset_conversion_rate(oracle_address: ContractAddress, asset : DataType) -> u128  {
    let oracle_dispatcher = IPragmaABIDispatcher{contract_address : oracle_address};
    let output : PragmaPricesResponse= oracle_dispatcher.get_data(asset,AggregationMode::ConversionRate);

    return output.price;
}

//USAGE
let oracle_address : ContractAddress = contract_address_const::<0x06df335982dddce41008e4c03f2546fa27276567b5274c7d0c1262f3c2b5d167>();
let price = get_asset_conversion_rate(oracle_address, DataType::SpotEntry((KEY)));
```

Alternatively, we implemented a specialized conversion rate feed that automatically calculates the conversion rate for specific feeds. Calling these feeds follows a process similar to retrieving spot BTC/USD prices.

**Supported feeds:**

| -------- | ------------------- | -------- |

## Technical Specification

### Function: `get_data_median`

This is the the simplest function that will aggregate all data into a median for a given data type.

#### Inputs

- `data_type`: enum of the data type you are requesting (See DataType structure). By providing the enum data type, you also provide the pair id (for spot entries), or the pair id and the expiration timestamp (for futures).

#### Returns

This function returns a struct, PragmaPricesResponse, which contains the following fields:

- `price`: aggregation result of all entries for the given key based on the robust median algorithm. Multiplied by `10**decimals`
- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy
- `last_updated_timestamp`: timestamp of the most recent entry aggregated
- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer
- `expiration_timestamp` : timestamp of when the data will expire. Works only for futures.

### Function : `get_data_median_for_sources`

This is the simplest function that will aggregate all data for given sources into a median for a given data type.

#### Inputs

- `data_type`: enum of the data type you are requesting (See DataType structure). By providing the enum data type, you also provide the pair id (for spot entries), or the pair id and the expiration timestamp (for futures).
- `sources`: array of sources to aggregate. Requires a Span of felt252.

#### Returns

This function returns a struct, PragmaPricesResponse, which contains the following fields:

- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer
- `expiration_timestamp` : timestamp of when the data will expire. Works only for futures.

#### Function: `get_data`

Similar to get_data_median except it allows for an additional parameter to specify a custom aggregated logic (median, mean and more).

#### Inputs

- `data_type`: enum of the data type you are requesting (See DataType structure). By providing the enum data type, you also provide the pair id (for spot entries), or the pair id and the expiration timestamp (for futures).

#### Returns

- `price`: aggregation result of all entries for the given key based on the robust median algorithm. Multiplied by `10**decimals`
- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy (fixed point)
- `last_updated_timestamp`: timestamp of the most recent entry aggregated
- `num_sources_aggregated`: number of sources aggregated in the final answer. Use this to check if one of the sources you requested was not available, or if there are enough data reports for you to rely on the answer
- `expiration_timestamp` : timestamp of when the data will expire. Works only for futures.

### Function: `get_data_with_USD_hop`

- `typeof` : SimpleDataType, represents an enum of the data type you are requesting. No pair_id /expiration timestamp required on the enum.
- `expiration_timestamp`: expiration timestamp of the data you are requesting. Only required for futures.

#### Returns

- `price`: aggregation result of all entries for the given key (using the algorithm specified by the `aggregation_mode` parameter). Multiplied by `10**decimals`
- `decimals`: number of places that value has been shifted to allow for greater accuracy (fixed point)
