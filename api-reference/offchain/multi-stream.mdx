<Note>
    This is an SSE endpoint. Learn more about SSE [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events).
     You can think of SSE as an unidirectional channel from the server to the client. 
    It is much more efficient than websocket to display real time data on a frontend and it is supported by most browsers as of today.
