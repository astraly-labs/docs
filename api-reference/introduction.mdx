# Pragma Node API

Pragma offers a highly accurate, readily available, and fast API built on our extensive network of data providers. This empowers developers to drive the evolution of next-generation applications. Our API provides the most reliable prices and financial data at the highest frequency possible.

## Base URL

<Tip>
  We recommend you use the **Development** endpoint until you are confident about going to production.
</Tip>

**Development**

```
https://api.devnet.pragma.build/node/v1
```

```
https://api.production.pragma.build/node/v1
```

## Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
X-API-KEY: <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

<Note>
  We are currently still in private beta, DM us on [twitter](https://x.com/pragmaoracle) or [telegram](https://t.me/bglabs) to get your own api key.

## API Groups

Our API is divided into the following categories:

- **Offchain** - Access to aggregated price data and real-time market information
- **Onchain** - Interact with on-chain price feeds and historical data
