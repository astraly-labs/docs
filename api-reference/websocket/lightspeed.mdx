# What

If all you need is the fastest and most accurate data in the market.
Then, you're in the perfect place.

This endpoint is very similar to our [StarkEx](./starkex.mdx) endpoint except it doesnt contain any metadata that would allow you to verify data's provenance.
On the other hand it's slightly more efficient as it doesn't have the signature generation overhead.

# How

Open a websocket connection on the environment of your choice.

e.g
```bash
wscat -c wss://ws.devnet.pragma.build/node/v1/price/subscribe
```

Sending a request to this endpoint establishes a channel to receive real-time data updates every 500 milliseconds.

## Subscribing

By default, no asset pairs are subscribed. To subscribe to specific pairs, send a message formatted as follows:

```json
{
  "msg_type": "subscribe",
  "pairs": ["BTC/USD", "ETH/USD:MARK"]
}
```

The server will confirm your subscription with a response like this:

```json
{
  "msg_type": "subscribe",
  // the pairs you are currently subscribed to, here we were already
  // subscribed to SOL/USD
  "pairs": ["BTC/USD", "ETH/USD:MARK", "SOL/USD"]
}
```

## Unsubscribing

To unsubscribe from specific pairs, send a message formatted as follows:

```json
{
  "msg_type": "unsubscribe",
  "pairs": ["BTC/USD"]
}
```

The server will confirm your unsubscription with a response like this:

```json
{
  "msg_type": "unsubscribe",
  // the pairs you are currently subscribed to
  "pairs": ["ETH/USD:MARK"]
}
```

## Response Format

Subscribed data will be provided in the following JSON format for each asset pair:

```json
{
  "pair_id": "0x12345",
  "price": "10000000000000001",
  "num_sources_aggregated": "8",
}
```

**Field Descriptions**:

- `pair_id`: Unique identifier for the asset encoded using the pair name.
- `price`: The median price of the asset.
- `num_sources_aggregated`: The number of sources that were aggregated for computing the median within the bucket.
