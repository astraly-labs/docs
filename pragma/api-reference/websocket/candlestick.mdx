## Overview

Looking for [OHLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-high-low-close_chart) data? You're at the right place. The Candlestick API provides real-time access to Open, High, Low, and Close price data at various time intervals.

<Note>
  Currently, we only support OHLC data for `onchain` data, but it will soon be available for `offchain` data as well.
</Note>
