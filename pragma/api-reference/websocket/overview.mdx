<Info>
WebSockets provide a persistent connection between your application and Pragma's servers, allowing for real-time data streaming with minimal latency.
</Info>

## Connection Endpoints

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Development">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash
    wss://ws.devnet.pragma.build/node/v1
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    <Tip>
      We recommend using the **Development** endpoint while building and testing your application.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Production">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash
    wss://ws.production.pragma.build/node/v1
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    <Warning>
      Only switch to the Production endpoint when your application is fully tested and ready for deployment.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authentication

<Info>
  All WebSocket connections are currently public and open without authentication.
</Info>

<Warning>
  In the near future, WebSocket connections will require authentication using an API key similar to the REST API. We recommend designing your implementation with this upcoming change in mind.
</Warning>

        This timeout prevents resource consumption from idle connections and ensures efficient server utilization.

    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Implement proper error handling">
    Always include robust error handling and reconnection logic in your WebSocket implementation. Network disconnections and server-side issues can occur, and your application should gracefully recover from these scenarios.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use ping/pong messages">
    Send regular ping messages (every 30 seconds) to keep the connection alive and detect stale connections early.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor connection health">
    Track connection state and performance metrics in your application to ensure reliable data delivery and prompt detection of issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement backoff strategy">
    When reconnecting after failures, use an exponential backoff strategy to avoid overwhelming the server during outages.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Closed Unexpectedly" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Rate limit exceeded (256 KB/s)
    - Inactivity timeout (60 seconds without messages)
    - Server maintenance or restarts
    
    **Solution:**
    Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff. Ensure you're sending ping messages every 30 seconds to keep the connection alive.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Message Format Errors" icon="bug">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Incorrectly formatted JSON messages
    - Missing required fields
    - Invalid subscription parameters
    
    **Solution:**
    Validate all outgoing message formats against the API documentation. Log and inspect error responses from the server.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="High Latency" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Possible causes:**
    - Network congestion
    - Geographic distance from server
    - Client-side processing delays
    
    **Solution:**
    Consider using a closer geographic endpoint if available. Optimize client-side message processing to reduce delays.
