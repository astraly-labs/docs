0D Finance is building the infrastructure for the commoditization of capital: programmable, transparent, and global.

Our first products are institutional-grade vaults that transform sophisticated market strategies into accessible onchain primitives, bringing efficiency, neutrality, and scale to the next era of decentralized finance.

## What We Do

We currate vault strategies that deliver consistent returns while minimizing risk through better capital allocation. Our goal is to make DeFi work like traditional finance should: efficient, accessible, and profitable for everyone.

## Key Principles

- **Capital Efficiency**: Maximizing returns while mitigating risk
- **Transparency**: Open and auditable strategies
- **Accessibility**: Making institutional-grade strategies available to all
- **Innovation**: Pioneering new approaches to decentralized finance

## Vault infrastructure

### Starknet

The USDC strategy relies on the [Starknet Vault Kit](https://github.com/ForgeYields/starknet_vault_kit/tree/main). The official open-source Starknet vault contracts. While the BTC strategy relies on the [Vesu vault](https://docs.vesu.xyz/explore/vaults), which is a derived version of the Starknet Vault Kit.

Both Starknet Vault Kit and Vesu Vault have been under multiple audits:

- The Starknet Vault Kit was audited by [Zenith](https://github.com/ForgeYields/audits/blob/main/Forge%20-%20Zenith%20Audit%20Report.pdf) and [Caro Security Clan](https://github.com/ForgeYields/audits/blob/main/Forge%20-%20Csc%20Audit%20Report.pdf)
- Vesu vault was audited twice by Sherlock: [2025.09.23](https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-reports/blob/main/audits/2025_09_23_Final_Vesu_Starknet_Vault_Kit_Collaborative_Audit_Report.pdf) & [2025.10.31](https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-reports/blob/main/audits/2025.10.31%20-%20Final%20-%20Vesu%20Vaults%20Collaborative%20Audit%20Report%201761914943.pdf)
