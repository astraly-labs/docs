# Introduction to 0D Finance

0D Finance is building the infrastructure for the commoditization of capital: programmable, transparent, and global.

Our first products are institutional-grade vaults that transform sophisticated market strategies into accessible onchain primitives, bringing efficiency, neutrality, and scale to the next era of decentralized finance.

## What We Do

We create vault strategies that deliver consistent returns while minimizing risk through better capital allocation. Our goal is to make DeFi work like traditional finance should: efficient, accessible, and profitable for everyone.

## Key Principles

- **Capital Efficiency**: Maximizing returns while minimizing risk
- **Transparency**: Open and auditable strategies
- **Accessibility**: Making institutional-grade strategies available to all
- **Innovation**: Pioneering new approaches to decentralized finance
